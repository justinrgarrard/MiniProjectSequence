### Preface 

To date, most of my work in the world of data science has taken the shape of homework assignments. It's been an adequate method for getting familiar with the wide-world of analytics, but hasn't fostered much in the way of practical experience. Enter the **Mini-Project Sequence**, a series of rapid-fire bite-sized projects designed to bring my skills from "oh I remember that class" to "I've done this before". The key elements of each project are:

* Choose a technique and a dataset 

* Build a proof-of-concept application in one week or less (no tutorials or step-by-step guides)

* Post the results with a write-up

I'll be recording these projects along with any interesting findings as we go along.
