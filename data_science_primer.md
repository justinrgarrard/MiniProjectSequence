### Objective

The purpose of this document is to serve as an inventory of analytics techniques the author has acquired. Firstly for reference purposes, so that he can track the many different techniques learned from coursework, research papers, and projects. Secondly, for communicative purposes, so that others can see at a glance what the author's mental model of Data Science looks like.

### Modeling 

Modeling is one of the most fundamental skills employed by analysts. It represents that ability to represent a situation mathematically, generally for one of two reasons:

* **Descriptive Modeling**: Understanding behavior, such as determining what factors have a strong influence on a student's grades.

* **Predictive Modeling**: Forecasting behavior, such as estimating future demand for a product based on previous demand.

Common modeling techniques, and examples of their usage, are listed in the table below.
